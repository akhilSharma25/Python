# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

A compact repository to track my Python learning — from basics to advanced — through short programs, concept implementations, and practice exercises.

## About
This repo contains small, focused examples and exercises covering core Python concepts to build a strong foundation for data science and real-world projects.

## Topics Covered
- Data types & variables
- Control flow (if, loops)
- Functions & modules
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- File I/O and error handling
- Problem-solving & algorithm practice

## Repository Structure
- /basics — beginner exercises and examples  
- /intermediate — functions, OOP, file handling  
- /projects — small practice projects 

## How to use
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the folder for the topic you want to practice.
3. Run the example scripts with `python <script>.py` or explore notebooks.

## Roadmap
Next up: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and introductory machine learning with scikit-learn.

Happy learning — every small script is a step forward! 🚀
